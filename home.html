        <p>
            The discovery of the universe expanding was hard to grasp as it questioned a lot of work done by Mathematicians and Physicists.
            This has led to a big question that has yet to be answered which is what is the topology of the universe.
            There have been multiple efforts in trying to find a possible solution.
            Researchers have gathered data through various satellites including Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe(WMAP) (2001-2010), Planck (2009-2013).
            The WMAP was sent into orbit in order to observe temperature fluctuations in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) that could be used to get clues as to what topology the universe might have.
            The Planck was sent into orbit to find anisotropies in the CMB.
            It is from this information that researchers have discovered some methods that may help to either eliminate possible topologies, or give us an answer.
            One of these methods include the idea of matching circles where researchers use computer programs to attempt to find copies of similar CMB radiation that are antipolar.
            The goal of this portfolio is to give a quick understanding of this process and what we know about the topology of the universe today.
            This portfolio begins by explaining what topology is and will explore different manifolds in 3 of the 8 Thurston geometries: Spherical, Euclidean, and Hyperbolic.
            Having an understanding of topology will help better understand why CMB could help find possibilities.
            Then we will go on to explore CMB and where it originated from.
            Then we will be able to discuss the current methods being used and how they work and their results.
