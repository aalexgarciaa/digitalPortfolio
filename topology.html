        <h2>Topology</h2>
        <p>This section will highlight some basic background information on topology that will be useful to understand exactly what researchers are looking for.
             Topology is the study of manifolds and the properties that are not affected by deformation.
             This means that we are focusing on properties that remain the same after we take a shape and bend it, or squish it.
             Let's say for example then that we have a 2 dimensional square and a 2 dimensional circle.
             They are not the same geometrically. However topologically they are equivalent, but not the same.
             If you were to mold the corners outward, you would get a circle. 
        </p>
        <h3>Topology is intrinsic focused</h3>
        <p>Topology is an intrinsic focused subject as we can transform manifolds on the outside and it would not affect the manifold in a way that is relevant in topology.
             An intrinsic property is a property inside a manifold, such as you being inside a room.
             If you changed something inside your room, that would be changing an intrinsic property.
             An extrinsic property is a change on the outside of a manifold through molding.
        </p>
        <h3>Orientation</h3>
        <p>Orientability is an intrinsic property that relates to whether an object that goes along a manifold will “flip” or appear mirror reversed.
             Let’s say for example that you are walking through your room, and at some point your room appears to be mirror reversed. 
             This would mean that your room is a non-orientable space. 
             Two manifolds that can be used to represent orientation could be the torus (Figure 1) vs a klein bottle (Figure 2). 
             A torus is a flat manifold that if you were to be inside and walk around, you will never ‘flip’. 
             However, if you were inside a klein bottle you would return from a full lap ‘flipped’.
