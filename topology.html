        <h2>Topology</h2>     
        <p>This section will highlight some basic background information on topology that will be useful to understand exactly what researchers are looking for.
             Topology is the study of shapes and spaces and the properties that are not affected by deformation.
             This means that we are focusing on properties that remain the same after we take a shape and continuously bend, or compress it.
             Let's say for example then that we have a square and a circle.
             They are not the same geometrically, but topologically they are equivalent.
             If you were to mold the corners inward of the square, you would get a circle.

        <h3>Manifolds</h3>
        <p>As you read through this page, you will see the term ‘manifold’ more often than the word shape or space.
             Manifold defines a special shape or space such that every point has a neighborhood that is topologically equivalent to Euclidean space.
             What this means is that on a shape or space, at any point you choose, its surrounding area if you zoom in can be continuously deformed into a piece of flat Euclidean space.
             Let’s take a 1-dimensional circle which is just a curve living in the 2 dimensional Euclidean plane.
             At any point you choose on that curve, it has a neighborhood that is topologically equivalent to an interval of real numbers, which is the Euclidean space of dimension 1.
             An example of a shape that is not a manifold is the infinity symbol.
             It is still a 1-dimensional curve living in the 2nd dimension.
             However at the center, there is an intersection.
             It is at this point where it no longer resembles an interval as it does at every other point.</p>

        <p>We will be focusing on 3-dimensional manifolds (denoted 3-manifold from here on out) because our spatial universe is 3-dimensional.
             However, if you are interested in learning more about manifolds, or even shapes and spaces that are not classified as manifolds, they can be found on the reference page. 
        </p>

        <h4>2-Manifolds</h4>
        <p>To explain 3-manifolds, we will first need to understand 2-manifolds. 
            2-manifolds are surfaces that are 2-dimensional. 
            There are various 2-manifolds, but we will focus on 4 different 2-manifolds: 
        </p>
            <ol>2-Torus</ol>
            <ol>Kleing Bottle</ol>
            <ol>2-Sphere</ol>
            <ol>Projective Plane</ol>
        <p><b>2-Torus:</b> A 2-torus can be thought of as a flat square with its opposite edges glued together.
             What we get resembles a donut. But it is important to remember that it is still flat because it is 2-dimensional.
             As you move through the 2 torus, you will forever be going in a circle.</p>
